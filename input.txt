How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
This is not a finished story .
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
He is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
Words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
He retreated into silence .
He died broken by history .
He is my grandfather .
I never knew him in real life .
